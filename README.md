## Weather App - hava

This app can view current local weather at a glance and powered by [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and [DarkSky API](https://darksky.net/dev/docs). Open it and view your local weather at a glance! You can also change temperature from °F to °C degrees using the switcher on top right.

## User Story

- I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
- I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
